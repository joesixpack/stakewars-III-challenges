A PRACTICAL PROPOSAL FOR STAKING FARM V2

Current liquidity mining incentives kickstarted by Compound during the DeFi Summer of 2020 suffer from a short-term incentivization of "liquidity locusts" -- temporary "farmers" that just rape farms and jump ship when the proverbial well runs dry.  There is no long-term loyalty or agency to the platform.  Below are several practical solutions to make the APY rewards sustainable (inclusive of the platform token, as well as non-platform tokens listed on the platform in some special cases):

Platform-Owned Liquidity

Issue all rewards as discounted bonds (in exchange for LP tokens, stablecoins and/or tokens) -- vesting the rewards over a period of time to prevent arbitration.  This will also eliminate impermanent loss for those providing liquidity.  To mitigate death spiral issues from self-reinforcing panic selling, the rewards must be allowed to be stakable at a commensurate APY to act as an effective token sink.

Platform-Governance

Grant reward hodlers the ability to participate in governance voting via vote-locking.  Such hodlers earn more rewards by committing their tokens to strictly voting for a set time period of time and actively participate in proposal votes.

Platform-Stability

Grant reward hodlers the ability to single-side stake their tokens for a set period of time to provide insurance against fat-tail shortfall events in return for increased rewards.  A portion of the locked tokens will be liquidated to cover the shortfall event.

Platform-Management

By single-side staking a predetermined amount of tokens, reward hodlers can gain permission to perform the necessary platform actions (functions) required for ongoing management and earn rewards for doing so.
