A PRACTICAL PROPOSAL FOR STAKING FARM V2

Current liquidity mining incentives kickstarted by Compound during the DeFi Summer of 2020 suffer from a short-term incentivization of "liquidity locusts" -- temporary "farmers" that just rape farms and jump ship when the proverbial well runs dry.  There is no long-term loyalty or agency to the platform.  Here's several practical solutions to make the APY rewards sustainable (inclusive of the platform token, as well as non-platform tokens listed on the platform in some special cases):


Sustainable Platform-Owned Liquidity

Issue all rewards as discounted bonds (in exchange for LP tokens or stablecoins) -- vesting the rewards over a period of time to prevent arbitration.  To mitigate death spiral issues from self-reinforcing panic selling, the rewards must be allowed to be stakable at a commensurate APY to act as an effective token sink.

This will also eliminate impermanent loss for those providing liquidity.

Governance

Grant reward hodlers the ability to participate in governance voting via vote-locking.  Such hodlers earn more rewards by committing their tokens to strictly voting for a set time period of time and actively participate in proposal votes.


Stability Fund

Grant reward hodlers the ability to stake their tokens for a set period of time to provide insurance against fat-tail shortfall events in return for increased rewards.  A portion of the locked tokens will be liquidated to cover the shortfall event.


Liquidity Depth

Concentrated liquidity (Uniswap v3) for platform-owned liquidity achieves superior capital efficiency, but comes at an increased risk of impermanent loss if the tools and skills to automate that liquidity provision are inadequate.

Fractionalized Ownership

Combining the bonding market mechanics of Olympus Pro with G-Uni's LP tokens will fractionalize the ownership of a single managed position on Uniswap v3.  This will incentivize market makers to provide value and allow the platform to gain control of that liquidity.
