I was curious about the Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) as applied to NEAR's mainnet validator stake distribution.  So I started collecting data and calculating the NC for NEAR as well as several other layer 1/2's (more will be added as time permits).  The higher the NC, the more decentralized a network is against disruption. NEAR's NC is alarmingly very low, implying an extreme degree of centralization and vulnerability to collusion.  NEAR should strongly consider how the NC changes when deciding on an effective delegation strategy to the forthcoming Chunk Producers.  The data can be visualized as a time series on my server at: http://65.109.27.142:3032/public/question/a94c097f-7ec3-4db3-9c45-8a4203110e32
